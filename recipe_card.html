                    <div class="content">
                       for the dumpling dough<br>
                        * 1 cup all-purpose flour – 125 grams <br>
                        * 1/2 teaspoon oil <br>
                        * 1/4 teaspoon salt or as required <br>
                        * 2 to 3 tablespoon water for kneading or as required <br>
                        for vegetable stuffing <br>
                        * 1 tablespoon oil <br>
                        * 2 small-sized spring onions (scallions) finely chopped – reserve the greens to be added later <br>
                        * 1/2 teaspoon finely chopped garlic or 3 to 4 small-sized garlic, finely chopped <br>
                        * 1.5 to 1.75 cups finely chopped mix vegetables (I added ½ cup chopped cabbage, ½ cup chopped carrots, ⅓ cup chopped french beans and ¼ cup chopped capsicum) <br>
                        * 1/2 cup chopped white button mushrooms – optional <br>
                        * 1 teaspoon soy sauce or add as required <br>
                        * 1/2 teaspoon black pepper powder or as required <br>
                        * salt as required

                    <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
                    <div class="content">
                        * Dough: Knead the dough to a firm texture. If the dough becomes soft, then add some flour and knead again. If the dough looks dry, then add 1 to 2 tablespoons water and continue to knead. <br>
                        Add your favorite veggies in the stuffing. Just a stuffing of button mushrooms or a mix of fresh mushrooms also taste good. You could even make a stuffing of mashed or boiled potatoes and paneer or even cheddar cheese. <br> 
                        * Seasonings: You can experiment in the stuffing and come up with different flavors. Add your favorite ground spices, herbs, sauces and seasonings. <br>
                        * Steaming: While steaming do keep some space between the momos. After steaming the dumplings expand and you don’t want them sticking to each other. You can steam in an Instant Pot, Electric Cooker, Stove-top Pressure cooker, a regular Pot or pan or even in a Idli steamer pan. <br>
                        * Checking for doneness: After the momos are steamed, when you touch the dough it should not feel sticky. The momos will also look transparent. <br> 
                        * Gluten Free: Using millet flour or rice flour to make these dumplings gluten free. Shaping them can be a tricky with a gluten free dough. To 1 cup of any millet flour or rice flour, add ½ teaspoon oil, ¼ teaspoon salt and enough boiling water to get a smooth dough. After adding hot water first mix with a spoon. Cover and let dough become warm and then knead to a smooth dough. <br>

                    <div class="content">
                        * Boil the pasta according to instructions on the package. I used regular penne pasta which was supposed to be boiled for 9 to 11 minutes. and drain. Make sure you don't overcook your pasta, you want it al-dente. Note: use only 1 cup pasta if you like more sauce in your pasta. While the pasta is boiling chop all the veggies. <br>* Once the pasta is boiled, drain it using a colander and set aside. <br>
                        * Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a pan on medium heat. Add all the veggies – onion, red pepper, broccoli florets and sweet corn. You can use other veggies like carrots, peas as well. <br> * Cook the veggies for 2 minutes and then remove on a plate. <br>
                        * To another pan or you can use the same pan, now add 1 tablespoon olive oil and the remaining tablespoon of butter. Once the butter melts, add the 5-6 chopped garlic cloves and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. <br>
                        * Then add in the flour. Whisk the flour continuously, using a wire whisk for around 30 to 60 seconds. You don't have to brown the flour much. <br>
                        * Add in the seasonings: Italian seasonings, dried oregano, red chili flakes, salt and black pepper. Mix in everything and let the sauce simmer. <br> 
                        * Sauce will thicken as it simmers and in 4 to 5 minutes it will coat the back of the spoon. Turn heat to lowest. <br>
                        * Add in the veggies and the boiled pasta back into the pan. Toss until the pasta and veggies are coated with the sauce. Taste test and adjust the seasonings at this point. Serve warm!
